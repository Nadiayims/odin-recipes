        <h3>Puffpuff</h3>

        <P>Is a deep-fried dough. They are made from yeast dough, shaped into balls and deep-fried until golden brown. It has a doughnut-like texture but slightly more chewy. It is a very common snack eaten by so many countries but with different names and a little bit of variation in the mode of preparation.</P>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Yeast</li>
            <li>Warm water</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preparation</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>Activate the yeast: Mix salt, water, sugar, and yeast. Set it aside for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Make the dough: Add flour and mix</li>
            <li>Rest and Rise: Let the mixture rise for approximately 1-2 hours</li>
            <li>Pre-heat the oil: In a large sauce pan, pour vegetable oil into a pot until it is about 3 inches (or 5 centimeters ) high (too little will result into a flatter balls), and place in low heat</li>
            <li>Check the heat: Test to make sure the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If the oil is not hot enough, the batter will stay at the bottom instead of rising to the top.</li>
            <li>Fry the puffpuff:Using your hands, grab a little bit of mixture at a time and drop into the oil </li>
            <li>Remove from oil: Use a large spoon or a slotted spoon to take it out of the oil. I usually place them on napkins right away to soak up some of the excess oil.</li>
            <li>Coat the puff puff: If desired, you can roll up the finished products in table sugar or powdered sugar to make it sweeter.<strong>Enjoy</strong></li>

        </ol>
